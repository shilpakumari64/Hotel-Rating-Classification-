# Hotel Reviews Analysis - NLP Project

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Hotel Reviews Analysis project. This project focuses on understanding the attributes that travelers consider while selecting a hotel. By analyzing hotel reviews, managers can gain insights into the elements of their hotel that influence positive reviews and improve their brand image.

## Objective

The major objective of this project is to identify the key attributes that travelers consider when selecting a hotel. By analyzing hotel reviews, we aim to determine which aspects of a hotel have a significant impact on forming positive reviews. This information can help hotel managers understand their strengths and areas for improvement, ultimately enhancing their brand image and customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze hotel reviews. By training different models on the reviews dataset, we aim to identify the most accurate model for predicting positive reviews. The final model achieved a 94% accuracy rate and is based on the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of hotel reviews. Each review contains text data that describes the traveler's experience and feedback regarding the hotel. The dataset is preprocessed and labeled with positive or negative sentiments to facilitate the model training and evaluation process.

## Approach

The project follows these key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by removing unnecessary characters, handling missing values, and performing other text preprocessing techniques.

2. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the text data, such as n-grams, TF-IDF, or word embeddings, to represent the reviews numerically for model training.

3. Model Training: Train different NLP models, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or LSTM, on the preprocessed and feature-extracted dataset.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

5. Model Selection: Select the most accurate model based on the evaluation results. In this project, the Naive Bayes model achieved a 94% accuracy rate and was chosen as the final model.

6. Insights and Recommendations: Analyze the results and identify the key attributes that influence positive reviews. Provide recommendations to hotel managers on areas for improvement or strategies to enhance their brand image.

## Tools Used

The following tools and technologies were used for this project:

- Python: Programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries: NLTK, spaCy, or others for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Scikit-learn: Library for machine learning tasks and model training.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for code development and documentation.
